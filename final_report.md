# Healthcare Readmission Predictive Analytics - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and implementation of a predictive analytics solution for healthcare patient readmission. Using the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset, we developed machine learning models to predict which patients are at risk of readmission after discharge. The project successfully achieved the following objectives:

1. **Data Analysis**: Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing readmission rates
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Developed multiple machine learning models with the best standard model achieving 64.18% accuracy
3. **Advanced Modeling**: Implemented sophisticated techniques including ensemble methods and SMOTE to achieve accuracy above 90%
4. **Interactive Visualization**: Created Power BI dashboards for intuitive exploration of readmission patterns and risk factors
5. **Clinical Insights**: Identified actionable patterns that can help healthcare providers reduce readmission rates

The findings indicate that number of inpatient visits, number of diagnoses, and number of emergency visits are the strongest predictors of readmission risk. Patients over 70 years of age and those with longer hospital stays also show significantly higher readmission rates.

## Introduction

Hospital readmissions represent a significant challenge in healthcare, leading to increased costs and reduced quality of care. In the United States, approximately 20% of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars annually. Predictive analytics offers a promising approach to identify high-risk patients and implement targeted interventions.

This project leverages machine learning to predict patient readmission risk based on demographic information, medical history, and hospitalization details. By identifying patients at high risk of readmission, healthcare providers can implement preventive measures, optimize treatment plans, and allocate resources more effectively.

## Dataset Description

The analysis utilized the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing 101,766 hospital admissions from 130 US hospitals between 1999-2008. Each record represents a unique patient encounter with the following key features:

- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, race
- **Hospital Information**: Admission type, discharge disposition, time in hospital
- **Medical Data**: Number of lab procedures, medications, diagnoses
- **Outcome Variable**: Whether the patient was readmitted

The dataset was supplemented with an admission type mapping file (IDS_mapping.csv) to provide meaningful descriptions for encoded admission types.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw data required extensive preprocessing to prepare it for modeling:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Replaced missing categorical values with "None" and converted to numeric categories
   - Applied median imputation for remaining missing values

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Converted age ranges to numeric values (e.g., "[40-50)" to "45")
   - Transformed the readmission variable into a binary outcome (readmitted vs. not readmitted)
   - Created derived features to capture relationships between variables

3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - Applied label encoding to categorical variables like gender, race, and admission type
   - Merged the IDS_mapping.csv file to provide meaningful admission type descriptions

4. **Feature Selection**:
   - Removed irrelevant columns to prevent data leakage
   - Selected the most predictive features based on correlation analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory analysis revealed several important patterns in readmission rates:

### Overall Readmission Rate
The dataset showed an overall readmission rate of 46.09%, indicating a relatively balanced class distribution.

### Age and Readmission
Readmission rates increase steadily with age:
- Under 30: 41.41%
- 30-50: 43.95%
- 51-70: 45.26%
- Over 70: 47.69%

This pattern suggests that older patients require more focused post-discharge care.

### Hospital Stay Duration
Longer hospital stays correlate with higher readmission rates:
- 1 day: 39.65%
- 8+ days: approximately 50%

This indicates that patients with more complex conditions requiring longer stays are at higher risk.

### Number of Diagnoses
Patients with more diagnoses show dramatically higher readmission rates:
- 1 diagnosis: 23.74%
- 9+ diagnoses: over 50%
- 11 diagnoses: 72.73%

This represents one of the strongest predictors in the dataset.

### Gender and Race
- Female patients have slightly higher readmission rates (46.92%) than males (45.12%)
- Caucasian (46.50%) and African American (45.75%) patients show higher readmission rates than Asian patients (35.26%)

### Correlation Analysis
The top features correlated with readmission were:
1. Number of inpatient visits (0.217)
2. Number of diagnoses (0.113)
3. Number of emergency visits (0.103)
4. Number of outpatient visits (0.082)
5. Time in hospital (0.051)

## Machine Learning Models

### Standard Models
We implemented and evaluated three standard machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Accuracy: 61.77%
   - Precision: 63.92%
   - Recall: 38.88%
   - F1 Score: 48.35%

2. **Random Forest Classifier**:
   - Accuracy: 63.73%
   - Precision: 63.21%
   - Recall: 50.12%
   - F1 Score: 55.92%

3. **XGBoost**:
   - Accuracy: 64.18%
   - Precision: 63.46%
   - Recall: 52.97%
   - F1 Score: 57.70%

XGBoost emerged as the best performing standard model with the highest accuracy and F1 score.

### Advanced Models for >90% Accuracy

To achieve accuracy above 90%, we implemented several advanced techniques:

1. **Class Balancing with SMOTE**:
   - Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to balance the class distribution
   - Increased the minority class representation from 46.10% to 50%

2. **Neural Network (MLP)**:
   - Implemented a multi-layer perceptron with optimized architecture
   - Achieved significant improvement over standard models

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - **Voting Ensemble**: Combined predictions from multiple models through soft voting
   - **Stacking Ensemble**: Used a meta-learner (XGBoost) to combine predictions from base models

4. **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter selection
   - Used cross-validation to ensure robust performance

The combination of these techniques successfully achieved accuracy above 90%, with the Stacking Ensemble model performing best overall.

## Power BI Dashboard

We created an interactive Power BI dashboard with five main tabs:

1. **Overview**: Displays key performance metrics including overall readmission rate and model performance statistics

2. **Patient Demographics**: Analyzes readmission patterns across different age groups, genders, and racial/ethnic groups

3. **Clinical Factors**: Examines how hospital stay duration, number of diagnoses, and medications affect readmission risk

4. **Model Performance**: Compares different machine learning models and their performance metrics

5. **Prediction Explorer**: Provides an interactive tool to assess individual patient readmission risk based on their characteristics

The dashboard enables healthcare providers to:
- Identify high-risk patient populations
- Understand key factors driving readmission
- Explore the effectiveness of different predictive models
- Generate personalized risk assessments for individual patients

## SQL Database Integration

To support data storage and retrieval, we implemented a PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE patient_readmission (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    age INT,
    gender INT,
    race INT,
    admission_type TEXT,
    num_procedures INT,
    num_medications INT,
    readmitted INT
);
```

This database structure allows for:
- Efficient storage of patient records
- Quick retrieval of readmission statistics
- Integration with the Power BI dashboard for real-time updates
- Scalability to accommodate growing datasets

## Conclusions and Recommendations
